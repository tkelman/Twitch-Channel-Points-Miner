# Twitch Channel Points Miner (Go)

Go rewrite of [0x8fv/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/0x8fv/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2) with a focus on speed and low overhead. This version keeps the same behavior (auto-claims bonuses, drops, and predictions) but trims dependencies, streams point updates over PubSub.

> Credits to the original maintained fork by [rdavydov](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2), whose work inspired this Go rewrite.

## Why this version
- Written in Go for faster start-up and lower CPU compared to the original runtime.
- Uses Twitch PubSub for near-instant point gain logging.
- Can target a manual list of streamers or mine everyone you follow.

## Quick start
1) Install Go 1.21+.
2) Copy `config.json` (it will be created/extended on first run) and set `username` plus any options you want. Leave the `streamers` array empty to mine all followed channels.
3) Run `go run .` (or `go build -o twitch-miner` and execute `./twitch-miner`).
4) On first launch you will see a device code prompt. Open `https://www.twitch.tv/activate`, enter the code, and wait until the app confirms login. Cookies are saved to `cookies/<username>.json` for future runs.
5) Press Ctrl+C to stop; a session summary is printed on exit.

When running a prebuilt binary, the miner uses `./config.json` if it exists in the current directory; otherwise it uses the directory containing the executable (so `config.json`, `cookies/`, and `log/` live next to the binary by default). Override with `-config`, `-data-dir`, `TCPM_CONFIG`, or `TCPM_DATA_DIR`.

## Configuration (config.json)
- `username`: Twitch login used for mining and for the cookie filename.
- `password`: Optional; device login is used, so you can leave this as-is.
- `debug`: Enable debug logs (high-level request summaries, PubSub message metadata).
- `debug_deep`: Enable deep debug logs (full request/response bodies and PubSub payloads); only emitted when `privacy.anonymize_logs` is `false`.
- `smart_logging`, `emojis`, `show_seconds`, `show_username_in_console`, `show_claimed_bonus_msg`: Console output preferences.
- `save_logs`: Write console output to `log/<username>.log` in addition to stdout.
- `privacy.anonymize_logs`: Replace streamer names and point balances in all logs with anonymized values; when enabled, `save_logs` writes to `log/miner.log`.
- `discord`: Optional Discord webhook notifications. Provide `webhook_api` plus `events` (list of event names to send). Supported events: `STARTUP`, `SHUTDOWN`, `STREAMER_ONLINE`, `STREAMER_OFFLINE`, `GAIN_FOR_RAID`, `GAIN_FOR_CLAIM`, `GAIN_FOR_WATCH`, `GAIN_FOR_WATCH_STREAK`, `BET_WIN`, `BET_LOSE`, `BET_REFUND`, `BET_FILTERS`, `BET_GENERAL`, `BET_FAILED`, `BET_START`, `BONUS_CLAIM`, `MOMENT_CLAIM`, `JOIN_RAID`, `DROP_CLAIM`, `DROP_STATUS`, `CHAT_MENTION`.
- `disable_ssl_cert_verification`: Disables TLS certificate/hostname verification for PubSub WebSockets only; leave `false` unless you know you need it.
- `timezone`: Optional IANA timezone name (e.g. `Europe/Berlin`) to override auto-detection for environments like Android/Termux; leave `null`/empty to auto-detect.
- `claim_drops_startup`, `claim_drops`, `follow_raid`: Auto-claim drops at boot, continue claiming while running, and auto-follow raid targets.
- `show_drops_progress`: When `true`, log compact `DROP_PROGRESS` status lines during the existing 30-minute drop inventory checks. Default `false` keeps drop logging limited to successful claims.
- `claim_moments`: Global default for listening to and claiming Twitch Moments via PubSub (`community-moments-channel-v1`). Per-streamer `streamer_overrides.<name>.claim_moments` still takes precedence.
- `betting(make_predictions)`: Enable Twitch prediction betting.
- `watch_streak_warm_start_cache`: When `true` (default), reuse recent watch-streak state for the same still-live stream across restarts to avoid re-probing every online channel at startup. The miner stores this account-scoped cache at `log/watch_streak_cache.<username>.json`.
- `disable_at_in_nickname`: When `true`, `CHAT_MENTION` also triggers on plain username mentions in chat (without requiring `@username`), matching the Python miner behavior.
- `streamers`: List of channel logins to mine; if empty, followers are mined in descending follow order.
- `streamers_exclude`: List of channel logins to skip (useful with an empty `streamers` list to mine all followed channels except specific ones); case-insensitive.
- `streamer_overrides`: Per-streamer overrides keyed by login; inherit from the global flags above. Example:
  ```json
  "streamer1": {
    "make_predictions": true,
    "follow_raid": false,
    "claim_drops": true,
    "claim_moments": false,
    "watch_streak": true,
    "community_goals": false,
    "bet": {
      "strategy": "SMART",
      "percentage": 5,
      "percentage_gap": 20,
      "max_points": 234,
      "minimum_points": 20000,
      "stealth_mode": true,
      "delay_mode": "FROM_END",
      "delay": 6,
      "filter_condition": {
        "by": "TOTAL_USERS",
        "where": "GTE",
        "value": 50
      }
    }
  },
  "streamer2": {
    "make_predictions": false,
    "follow_raid": true,
    "claim_drops": false,
    "claim_moments": true,
    "watch_streak": false,
    "community_goals": true,
    "bet": {
      "strategy": "PERCENTAGE",
      "percentage": 10,
      "percentage_gap": 15,
      "max_points": 5000,
      "minimum_points": 0,
      "stealth_mode": false,
      "delay_mode": "FROM_START",
      "delay": 3,
      "filter_condition": null
    }
  }
  ```
- `show_game`: When true, log the game a streamer is playing on join and on watch-point gains.
- `game_priority` / `game_exclude`: Ordered game names to prefer and names to skip entirely. Leave empty to keep the default behavior; matches are case-insensitive.
- `bet`: Advanced prediction tuning. Defaults are applied when values are `null`:
  - `strategy`: Default `SMART` (see `entities.Strategy` for options such as `MOST_VOTED`, `HIGH_ODDS`, `SMART_MONEY`, etc.).
  - `percentage`: Percent of points to bet (default 5).
  - `percentage_gap`: Minimum edge between outcomes before betting (default 20).
  - `max_points`: Cap per bet (default 50000).
  - `minimum_points`: Skip bets below this balance (default 0).
  - `stealth_mode`: If true, bets favor lower-visibility patterns (default false).
  - `delay_mode` / `delay`: When to place the bet (default `FROM_END`, 6 seconds).
  - `filter_condition`: Optional object to skip betting unless a live metric meets your rule. Example: `{ "by": "TOTAL_USERS", "where": "GTE", "value": 50 }` to skip bets until at least 50 users participate. `by` supports `PERCENTAGE_USERS`, `ODDS`, `ODDS_PERCENTAGE`, `TOP_POINTS`, `TOTAL_USERS`, `TOTAL_POINTS`; `where` supports `GT`, `LT`, `GTE`, `LTE`.

## How it works
- Authenticates via Twitch device flow, persists cookies per user, and refreshes the client build id for GQL calls.
- Loads channel points context to grab balances and blue chests; watches two live streams at a time for minute-watched events to keep streaks active.
- If you have an active subscription (multiplier) on a streamer, their name is highlighted in gold everywhere it appears in the logs so you can quickly spot priority channels.
- Listens to PubSub (`community-points-user-v1`) for instant point gain updates and logs deltas with reasons.
- Periodically claims inventory drops, can optionally log drop progress during those checks, and can auto-join raids and continue mining the destination channel.

## Notes
- Tested with Go 1.21; dependencies are in `go.mod`.
- Shortcut commands: `go fmt ./...` to format, `go test ./...` to run unit tests.
- macOS: if Finder opens the downloaded binary in a text editor, run it from Terminal and make it executable first (e.g. `chmod +x TwitchChannelPointsMiner-darwin-arm64`).
